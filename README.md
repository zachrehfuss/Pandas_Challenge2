# Pandas_Challenge2

In this file you will find a folder titled PyCitySchools that contains my python file 
and another file named "Resources" that house the CSVs that I ran the code on. 

Alongside that, the document titled Module 4 analysis houses both my summary and my conclusions.

For my code, I worked with multiple of my peers to help with some debugging I had encountered.
Alongside that, I used Xpert Learning assistant to help me resolve some of the issues that I ran into. 
I encountered a lot of issues when I was working with the given code for the Per_school_summary.
When I ran the code to format the dataframe it turned everything into objects
instead of integers and floats. In order to write and confirm the rest of my code worked,
I had to comment out the code. It causes an error when I try to pd.cut() on the per_school_capita
series.
