# Pandas_Challenge2

In this file you will find a folder titled PyCitySchools that contains my python file 
and another file named "Resources" that house the CSVs that I ran the code on. 

Alongside that, the document titled Module 4 analysis houses both my summary and my conclusions.

For my code, I worked with multiple of my peers to help with some debugging I had encountered.
Alongside that, I used Xpert Learning assistant to help me resolve some of the issues that I ran into. 
I encountered a few issues when I was working with the given code for the Per_school_summary.
When I ran the code to format the dataframe it turned everything into objects
instead of integers and floats. In order to write and confirm the rest of my code worked,
I had to comment out the code. It causes an error when I try to pd.cut() on the per_school_capita
series. This code was given to us in the initial python file 
and has no effect on the outcomes of the information. You can see the commented out code in the file.
I used formatting later on in the code and ran into no issues 
and to show I know how to format and map variables.
